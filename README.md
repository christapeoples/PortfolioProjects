Project Summary:
In this project, I worked with a dataset of movie data, exploring, cleaning, and analyzing the data using Python and various data analysis techniques. We performed tasks such as data cleaning, data type conversion, dealing with missing values, and visualizing the data to gain insights. Here are some key findings and final analysis:

Data Cleaning: I cleaned the dataset by addressing missing values, converting data types, and handling non-numeric entries.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We performed EDA to understand the characteristics of the dataset and visualize relationships between variables. Key visualizations included scatterplots, bar charts, and heatmaps.

Correlation Analysis: I calculated correlation coefficients to examine relationships between variables, such as budget, gross revenue, and other movie features. I found strong positive correlations between budget and gross revenue, indicating that higher budgets tend to result in higher gross revenue.

Company Analysis: I also analyzed movie features by company, creating a heatmap to visualize the relationships between companies and movie metrics.

Data Visualization: I improved the visual appeal of our plots and ensured that text was wrapped for better readability.

Limitations: It's important to note that correlation does not imply causation. While I identified correlations between variables, I cannot conclude that one variable directly causes changes in another based solely on correlation.

Conclusion:
This project allowed me to explore and analyze a movie dataset, identify relationships between variables, and gain insights into the factors that influence a movie's success. It demonstrated the power of data analysis and visualization for making data-driven decisions and extracting valuable information from complex datasets.
